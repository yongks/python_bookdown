# Fundamentals

## Library Management

### Built-In Libraries

```{python}
import string
import datetime as dt
import os
#os.environ['QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH'] = "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\plugins\platforms"
```

### External Libraries

Here are some of the popular external libraries.

**numpy**
- large multi-dimensional array and matrices  
- High level mathematical funcitons to operate on them 
- Efficient array computation, modeled after matlab  
- Support vectorized array math functions (built on C, hence faster than python for loop and list)  

**scipy**
- Collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the numpy extension  
- Built upon **numpy**

**Pandas**
- Data manipulation and analysis 
- Offer data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series  
- Good for analyzing tabular data  
- Use for exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, statistics and visualization
- Built upon **numpy**

**scikit-learn**
- Machine learning functions  
- Built on top of **scipy**

**matplotlib**
- Data Visualization


### Package Management

### Anaconda

#### Conda Environment {-}

Anaconda is a popular package management system for python. Interaction with anaconda is through command prompt "conda".

```
conda info ## check the installed conda version and directories
conda list ## list all installed python modules, and its version
```

#### Package Installation {-}

Conda is recommended distribution. To install from **official** conda channel:

```
## Syntax
conda install <package_name>                 # always install latest
conda install <package_name=version_number>  ## install specific version

## Example
conda install scipy        ## official channel
conda install scipy=1.2.3  ## official channel
```

To install from **conda-forge** community channel:

```
conda install -c conda-forge <package_name>
conda install -c conda-forge <package_name=version_number>

## Example: Install From conda community:
conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
conda install -c conda-forge plotnine=1.2.3

```

### PIP

PIP is python open repository (not part of conda). Use **pip** if the package is not available in conda.

#### Package Version {-}

```
pip list ## list all installed module
```

#### Package Installation

```
pip install <package_name>
pip install <package_name=version_numner>

## Example: 
pip install plydata
pip install plydata=1.2.3
```

## Variables Are Objects

- All variables in python are **objects**  
- Every variable assginment is **reference based**, that is, each object value is the reference to memory block of data 

In the below example, **a, b and c ** refer to the **same memory location**: 

- Notice when an object assigned to another object, they refer to the same memory location  
- When two variable refers to the same value, they refer to the same memory location

```{python}
a = 123
b = 123  
c = a
print ('Data of a =',  a,
       '\nData of b =',b,
       '\nData of c =',c,
       '\nID of a = ', id(a),
       '\nID of b = ', id(b),
       '\nID of c = ', id(c)
)
```

Changing data value (using assignment) changes **the reference**

```{python}
a = 123
b = a
a = 456  # reassignemnt changed a memory reference
         # b memory reference not changed
print ('Data of a =',a,
     '\nData of b =',b,
     '\nID of a = ', id(a),
     '\nID of b = ', id(b)
)
```

## Assignment

### Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple variable at the same time with same value.  Note that all object created using this method refer to the **same memory location**.

```{python }
x = y = 'same mem loc'
print ('x = ', x,
     '\ny = ', y,
     '\nid(x) = ', id(x), 
     '\nid(y) = ', id(y)
)
```

### Augmented Assignment

```{python }
x = 1
y = x + 1
y += 1
print ('y = ', y)
```

### Unpacking Assingment

Assign multiple value to multiple variabels at the same time.

```{python, }
x,y = 1,3
print (x,y)
```
