This is my python programming cookbook, made using RMarkdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

RMarkdown is to run code chunks. Bookdown is to render the markdown files and arrange them into HTML output such such as gitbook, html, pdf, etc.

You may refer to the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for using bookdown.
